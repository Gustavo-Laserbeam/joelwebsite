<h2>1.1 -> 1.4</h2>
<p>1.1 - For modern business plans to be successful, IT must become a prominent part of the plan. IT plays a role in business, whether it be huge businesses found across the world to small businesses that operate from one computer in a garage. One of the main reasons why it is so vital to a business is because of customer outreach methods, which utilises emails to contact people. This is not just for customers - emails can be used to contact suppliers and employees. The emailing method is seen as one of the cornerstones of the internet, and has also evolved into various other means of communication such as chat rooms and video calling. IT also excels in terms of management and information systems, which are vital for a modern business. Stock levels have been made much easier with information system, which automatically detects when an item becomes out of stock. Data management systems have also made things easier for businesses by eliminating the need for a hard copy of a dataset, as they can all be stored on a computer. To further add to the data storage systems method, the type of data stored can indicate to a business which products are doing well or not doing well, which can be altered to meet customer satisfaction.

<p>1.2 - There are many methods, resources and skills that must be utilised to make sure digital project management run smoothly. A main component that can lead to successful management of a project is the writing and editing skills that the manager possesses. The editing allows the content to be grammatically correct and the writing must be displayed in a way that makes the reader want to learn about the product in question. This is absolutely vital when communicating product specifics. Another thing to include would be analysis of data, which is very important to project management. The analysis can also serve as a status update, as excel software can be used to track the progress of a project. A company will expect reports related to whereabouts the project is. Making effort to interact with people in and out the company can be a very effective skill in project management. This means using formats such as email and video chat to interact with employees and stakeholders to remind them that they are people, not just components of the company. To keep up with a number of tasks in project management, a lot of care needs to be put in to keep consistency in each component. To prevent this from happening, being able to adapt to a changing environment is a priceless skill to have. A project can still be successful if the changes are correctly addressed.

<p>1.3 -  Using a task management site such as Trello allows a user to make sure that the relevant tasks are carried out. It also functions in a way that the user can focus on one task at a time, using cards to indicate whether a task has been completed or not. In terms of planning the layout to the website, the idea was to not overload each page with information - a maximum of around 4 unit components on each page. Before any of this, methods of using html must be utilised to deploy the building blocks of the website. A breakdown of editorial and insertion methods with a combination of a run through of CSS allows the user to gain a basic understanding of how websites are built. <a href="https://trello.com/b/0pMk5XcN/website-planning">Here is a link to my trello board</a>

<p>1.4 - While the payoff for a project can be great, there are a number of risks that can cause it to become compromised. Firstly, cost risk - This can happen in the case of poor budgeting and poor estimation of expenditure. As a project gains traction, it is important to keep track of the amount of money available. It is also important to important to remember scheduling. Due to poor time management, some parts of the projects will take longer than previously thought. This type of risk can also lead to a higher chance of a cost risk, losing out to a competitor and prevent the acquisition of project benefits. Finally, it is also important to remember performance issues. The project may fail to live up to specifications, resulting in a product that doesn’t match the promising specifications. Strategic risk - These can arise when using a type of technology that is too complex for a common user or using technology that doesn’t work as well as previously thought.</p>
