<p>1.5 - Selecting the correct the IT systems and software to craft this website is incredibly important part of management process. The first step to selecting the most suitable software is to understand what tasks the software must carry out. Therefore, knowing what the system must do, what problems may be encountered  and how to use efficiently use the software are vital pieces of knowledge. A sensible idea would be to make a list of software requirements such as functional, usability, technological, budgetary requirements and scalability. The next step would be to being a search for relevant applications that carry the most suitable schematics. A logical step would to create a list of all known and researched applications and use the process of elimination to narrow down the list. There are also websites that compare software packages, aiding in the selection process. Once the list has been compiled, many of the applications can start to be removed from the list. This must be done quickly to get rid of the most unsuitable software,  using a list of criteria that will be needed for the project. For example, a technology preference can make or break the selection of a software package i.e the software may only work on a windows computer and the user is in possession of a Mac. This along with budgetary restrictions represent criteria that donâ€™t require trial runs of software, so software with these limitations can be eliminated. Once the software has been selected, a trial run can be carried out.
    </p>    <p>1.6 - The software used in the planning and creation of this website is designed to help the user utilise the tools of website creation and how create a step by step process for the methodology involved. Trello is a web-based list making application that allows the user to present tasks in a clear manner, columns that indicate whether a task is in progress and when a task is complete. The idea of this is to make sure each task is completed individually, rather than starting a new task after not completing the task before it. The use of Trello in this project was to ensure the written components  were understood and completed. The site sharing company Github served as a way to upload website design progress over a number of days, using repositories to upload a link to the website.</p>
<p>1.7 -There are certain guidelines that can cause roadblocks for users implicated in digital projects. The EU GDPR is an act that is designed to protect the data of individuals as of 25/05/2018. It is designed to protect the privacy of individuals, with aims such as: data portability, the right to be forgotten, the right to prevent profiling and the right the rectification and erasure. In a similar way to government bodies, documents involved in projects collect information on individuals. If the personal information is collected electronically then GDPR applies, so the document will need to be ready to be searched. The software used in projects can also implicate GDPR, as many projects involve the enhancement software. This process involves the use of test data, which in turn will involve using personal data. GDPR will ensure that the individual will have the guidelines displayed to them at the start of the test. To help the GDPR in this process, it is good practice for projects to encrypt data produced from tests.
