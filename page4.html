<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h1>
<h1>2.1 -> 2.5</h1>
<p>2.1 - In relation to the tools used in building this website, visual studio code proved to be a very useful medium for entering code for HTML and CSS. VSC is designed to be very easy to use for whatever level the user is at, as the layout is clear and the code entering areas. As a beginner to using VSC, I found it very easy to use in terms of entering and editing code. I initially did have some issues with sending my work to Github, but that was resolved after a few attempts. When it came to using Trello, I initially thought I would utilise its functions to make sure all the tasks were completed. After entering all of the units for the written work that had to be done, I realised I didnâ€™t need to rely on Trello to make sure I completed the work. </p>
<p>2.2 - VSC allows the user to enter code in the form of javascript/HTML/CSS, used mainly in projects. This project required the use of HTML and CSS, so a program such as VSC was very appropriate for a project like this. Although I did not make full use of Trello, it is perfectly suited to making sure that all tasks are completed. </p>
<p>2.3 - I am somewhat happy with my website, but there are strengths and weaknesses to it. One of its main strength is that it is very simple to navigate, as the tabs at the top of the page allows the user to switch between the pages very freely with clear labels. It also possesses  a very vibrant homepage, with gifs to make sure the page is inviting. The website is readable and serves its purpose, but one its weaknesses is that the colour scheme is lacking and there is a dull feel to the pages, which may be due to my own design skills. In the future I would learn how to manipulate text, images and videos to implement them into a website.</p>
<p>2.4 - I would improve my website by learning how to implement a variety of texts, as the same text throughout  is something that makes the website feel lacklustre. I would also possibly add a welcome page before the index page, as the index page currently serves as both. In conclusion, I would have been a lot more creative and taken time to enhance the colour scheme.</p>
<p>2.5 - The main outcome for this project was to create a website that informed others about myself, including why I came to codenation and the sort of hobbies I enjoy. The main requirements were to see if we could manipulate images, text, menus etc. I believe I have correctly displayed this in my website.</p>
