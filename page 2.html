<h2>1.1</h2>
<p>For modern business plans to be successful, IT must become a prominent part of the plan. IT plays a role in business, whether it be huge businesses found across the world to small businesses that operate from one computer in a garage. One of the main reasons why it is so vital to a business is because of customer outreach methods, which utilises emails to contact people. This is not just for customers - emails can be used to contact suppliers and employees. The emailing method is seen as one of the cornerstones of the internet, and has also evolved into various other means of communication such as chat rooms and video calling. IT also excels in terms of management and information systems, which are vital for a modern business. Stock levels have been made much easier with information system, which automatically detects when an item becomes out of stock. Data management systems have also made things easier for businesses by eliminating the need for a hard copy of a dataset, as they can all be stored on a computer. To further add to the data storage systems method, the type of data stored can indicate to a business which products are doing well or not doing well, which can be altered to meet customer satisfaction.
