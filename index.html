      <h1>About me</h1>
   </div>
 <p>Hello there, my name is Joel and I am 26 years old. I graduated from the University of Salford last year with a degree in Zoology, so I do not have any prior coding experience and have very basic computer skills. After having difficulty finding any work in my field and in general, I decided to enrol myself on a course that could provide me with some vital skills. From various people and a family member, I witnessed first hand people taking to coding and software development and progressing quickly. It is for this reason I believe that there will always be coding jobs available and with practice anyone can carve their way into this area. In the meantime, I am very happy to be learning a new skill.
    In my free time I enjoy hiking, bouldering, video games, going to the cinema, reading and researching parts of my own field.</p>
