<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 3</h1>
<h2>3.1 -> 3.4</h2>
<p>3.1 - In terms of the tools and systems used in the site’s creation, the majority of them were very up to date in terms of productivity and efficiency. VSC is an incredibly efficient way of entering code and connecting it to a webpage, whether that means quickly making changes to the website or uploading the pages to GitHub. The drawback to this is that this does require teaching and careful instruction before making use of the impressive functions, so it may take a bit of time to teach an individual to correctly use them. I could have maybe improved my efficiency by taking more time to get a second opinion before inserting content.  I preferred to work on my own rather than work in a team for this project, as it involves inputting your own information and style. This may have lead to an idea overload and maybe disagreements as to what content should be on the website.  </p>
<p>3.2 - I could have improved my productivity and efficiency by taking more time to read through instructional slides, especially those including the upload of pages to GitHub. While GitHub is a great asset for website design sharing, I constantly had to remind myself of the stages that allows a user to upload their work to the site. I feel like I wasted time having to go through the steps of an upload each time, so I could have been more efficient by either learning the steps or by having a resource I can refer to quickly.</p>
<p>3.3 - There are many ways in which I could have improved my own efficiency on the project. IT provides a lot of resources to improve your performance, so they must be made utilised correctly. I would have maybe used Slack as a means to get a second opinion of my work, as my design skills are poor and another point of view could have pointed things out to me. I still don’t see how team work would have helped me in this project, as too many ideas and design elements may have caused many problems. I could have also looked into time management software such as TimeBoy, which tracks performance and lets the user know how long they have spent on each component. </p>
<p>3.4 - For digital solutions related to this website, they must show that the website functions properly. This was done by making sure the code was saved every time there was a change, then checking the website to see if the changes had taken place. I had to make sure that the website flowed correctly for other users, so I had someone else check to make sure they could use it. The navigation bar at the top made it very easy for the user to switch from one page to the other, with clear way to get back to the index page. </p>
