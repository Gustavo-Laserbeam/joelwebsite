<h1>Unit 2 Outcome 1</h1>
<h2>1.1 -> 1.7</h2>
<p>1.1 - The index page of my website contains the most visual content, as it displays my about me section that is placed between two gifs I inserted. While the website has been described as a bit of a mess, the gifs and background images used along with their position are meant to have a chaotic style. The navigation tab is found at the top left, which is a feature on every page that allows for easy navigation between pages. This background and images used are from TV shows/films that I enjoy. The next pages follow a similar format, with the navigation tab in the top left and the headings indicating the unit number. I chose to place around 3-5 unit components on each page, which greatly reduced the amount of pages. The final page serves as a contact page, where I display my name and email address. </p>
<p>1.5 - Copyright laws can affect websites as it may restrict what people are allowed to publish. The way to make sure this isnâ€™t a problem is to make sure you get permission from the original author, as this does not infringe on any copyright law. It is also possible to display information from another site if there is a link to the original, or if there is valid permission to use text published by the original author.</p>
<p>1.6 - People with disabilities may struggle to use my website as the gifs on the index page coupled with the jarring background may cause a bit of an overload. This could affect users with visual problems, so it may be a good idea in the future to make the background image less impactful. To add to the visual problems, a person that is short sighted may struggle to read the navigational tabs at the top of the page, which could be overcome by making the navigational bar bigger.</p>
<p>1.7 - The most appropriate filetypes for websites would be mainly media filetypes,  which show images/videos/gifs. The main language used is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language file) that serves as the main frame for the website. Any files that end in .JPG or .JPEG will (Joint Photographic Experts Group file) will present itself an image when entered correctly. An files that end in .GIF (Graphics Interchange Format file) will show up as gif. As for website enhancements, CSS (Cascading StyleSheets file) is used to add  colour, change fonts, add background images and many more functions.</p>
